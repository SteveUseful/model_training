# Model Training Project

## Introduction
This project is dedicated to developing and training machine learning models for churn prediction. It aims to provide an accurate and efficient tool for identifying potential customer churn, helping businesses to proactively address this issue.

## Features
- **Churn Prediction**: Utilizes historical data to predict customer churn.
- **Advanced Machine Learning Techniques**: Incorporates the latest algorithms and practices in machine learning.
- **Performance Metrics**: Includes detailed evaluation metrics to assess model accuracy and performance.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
```bash
pip install numpy
pip install pandas
pip install scikit-learn

## Installation
Clone the repository and install the required packages:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/SteveUseful/model_training.git
cd model_training
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
Here's a quick example of how to train and predict using the model:

python
Copy code
from model_training import Trainer

trainer = Trainer(data_path="path/to/your/data.csv")
model = trainer.train()
predictions = model.predict("path/to/your/newdata.csv")
